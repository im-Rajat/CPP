# Constructor

- It's philosophically wrong when we create rectangle object, it's length and breadth were garbage/not define (we set letter).
- While creating or buying any rectangle object we also tell what should be its length and breadth
- So we want the length and breadth to be set at the time of construction of that object. So we should have a function which should be automatically called when this object is constructed so that it take these parameters and assign these values.
- A constructor is a function which will have the same name as class name.
- The constructor will not have any return type but it will have same name as class name exactly same.
